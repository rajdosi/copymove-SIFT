Object instance recognition practical
=====================================

> A computer vision practical by the Oxford Visual Geometry group,
> authored by Andrea Vedaldi and Andrew Zisserman.

Start from `doc/instructions.html`.

Package contents
----------------

The practical consists of four exercies, organized in the following
files:

* `exercise1.m` -- Part I: Sparse features for matching specific
  objects in images
* `exercise2.m` -- Part II: Affine co-variant detectors
* `exercise3.m` -- Part III: Towards large scale retrieval
* `exercise4.m` -- Part IV: Large scale retrieval

The computer vision algorithms are implemented by
[VLFeat](http://www.vlfeat.org). This package contains the following
MATLAB functions:

* `findNeighbours.m`: Match features based on their descriptors.
* `geometricVerification.m`: Geometrically verify feature matches.
* `getFeatures.m`: Extract features from an image.
* `getHistogramFromImage.m`: Get a feature hisotgram from an image.
* `getHistogram.m`: Get a feature histogram from quantised features.
* `loadIndex.m`: Load an image datbase with an inverted index.
* `plotbox.m`: Plot boxes.
* `plotMatches.m`: Plot feature matches.
* `plotRetrievedImages.m`: Plot search results.
* `plotQueryImage.m`: Plot the query image for a set of search results.
* `search.m`: Search an image database.
* `setup.m`: Setup MALTAB to use the required libraries.

Appendix: Installing from scratch
---------------------------------

1. From Bash, run `./extras/bootstrap.sh`. This will download the
   Oxford 5k practical data.
2. From MATLAB, run `addpath extras ; preprocess`. This will download
   the VLFeat library (http://www.vlfeat.org) and compute a visual
   index for the Oxford 5k data.
3. From MATALB, run `addpath extras ; preprocess_paintings`. This will
   download and index a number of painting images from Wikipedia.
4. From Bash, run `make -f extra/Makefile pack`. This will pack the
   practical in archives that can be redestributed to students.

%   NN = FINDNEIGHBOURS(DESCRS1, DESCRS2) finds for each column of
%   DESCRS1 the closest column of DESRS2 (in Eulclidean distance)
%   storing the index to NN. The function uses a KDTree for
%   apporximate but fast matching.
%
%   NN = FINDNEIGHBOURS(DESCRS1, DESCRS2, NUMNEIGHBOURS) returns
%   NUMNEIGHBOUSRS neighbours by increasing distance, storing them
%   as successive rows of NN.
%
%   [NN, DIST2] = FINDNEIGHBOURS(...) returns the corresponding
%   matrix of distances DIST2 as well.
